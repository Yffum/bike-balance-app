# To Do

## Frontend
- [ ] Add cancel button for simulation
- [ ] Add handling for simulation call fail
- [ ] Add setting for python name/path e.g. python3

## Simulation
- [ ] Add station validation for basic agent
- [ ] Improve station validation for smart agent
- [ ] Add station agnostic batch setting

- [ ] Try diminishing reward value with time (or node depth) for smart agent
- [ ] Search branches that end early should be considered less valuable (some function of the time passed of maybe node depth)

## Finalization
- [ ] Verify default_user_params.json works

## Future Work
- Add interface for loading and managing (e.g. removing) previous results
- Sim parameters
  - Rental strategy: [selfish, cooperative/fair]
